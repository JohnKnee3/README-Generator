  ## Description
  This is my seventh challenge for the UofU bootcamp. In it you will find a README Generator that asks you a series of questions in the terminal and then generates a README based on your reponses.

  ## Table of Contents
  - [Installation](#installation)
  - [Usage](#usage)
  - [License](#license)
  - [Contributing](#contributing)
  - [Tests](#tests)
  - [Questions](#questions)
  

  ## Installation
  Go into your terminal in the develop folder and type npm install inquirer.  This will get you the files needed to load the questions. 

  ## Usage 
  Use this to create a README for your projects.

  
  ## License

  A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.
